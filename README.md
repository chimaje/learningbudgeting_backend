The **backend** for **LearnBudget**, a full-stack budgeting application that helps people **track and manage their finances effectively**.  

LearnBudget takes inspiration from the **detailed Excel budgeting sheets** people often use but provides a **smarter, simpler, and more automated experience**. It’s built to teach users how to budget while helping them stay on top of their **income, expenses, and savings goals**.

This backend is built using **Spring Boot** for scalable API development
